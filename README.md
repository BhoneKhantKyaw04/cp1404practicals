Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404
## ABOUT
This repository contains my practical work for the subject CP1404 - Programming 2 at JamesCook University.
My name is Bhone Khant Kyaw. I am learning Python through practical exercises focused on clean code, file handiling, classes, and object-oriented programming.
## Lessons Learned
• I learned how important it is to use meaningful variable and function names so that the code is easy to understand later.
• I understand the value of separating logic into functions to follow the Single Responsibity Principle (SAP).
• I realized that consistently formatting and indenting my code makes it much easier to read and debug.
• I learned that writing docstrings for each function helps others (and future me) know what the function is doing.
• I now use enumerate instead of range(len(...)) when looping through lists, which makes my loops cleaner and more Pythonic.
